      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!--TODO <p> tags!! -->

        I'm Brian.  I am writing to you on Feb 14, 2023.
      
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

        Nowadays,
        
        <ul>          
          <li>
            I get a lot of reading in.  You can find my reading list
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/193ip3sbePZb1kLdFA60VzbpeCzSwX7BD5dzPxsfM28Q/edit#gid=0">
            here</a>.  I try to get a 50-50 split of fiction and non-fiction books.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm in a crew that does a weekly trivia night.  We're good!  We pretty reliably bring
            home the 25-bar-dollars prize.
          </li>
          <li>Also, me and some buddies are doing a
            <a href="https://www.asmodee-digital.com/en/gloomhaven/">Gloomhaven</a> campaign.  It's
            been fun so far; we're coming up on the first boss fight on our next night.  I play a
            cragheart named Craig Heart.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Formerly,
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            I liked rock climbing.  Though when I tried getting back into it in 2022, the gym was
            just a <i>little</i> too far out of the way, and the bouldering routes got reset just a
            <i>little</i> too slowly.  If I took it up again, it'd be because I had a top-rope
            partner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Skiing is a lot of fun, but it's hard driving up to Tahoe from Santa Clara county.
          </li>
          <li>
            I did some beginner-level glass blowing.  To show for it, I have a pair of little cups
            and a large, wonky vase that do their jobs just fine.  It's really fun, and I hope to
            pick it back up again.  Maybe even make something someone else would want in their home!
          </li>
          <li>
            And I used to have a three-movies-a-week habit.  Netflix was 
            <a href="https://github.com/bgawalt/netflixtank">mailing me discs</a> as recently as
            Oct 2020.  Noir and crime worked especially well on me.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Career & Education</h3>        

        (<a href="./resources/gawaltResume2023.pdf">Here's my resume.</a>)<br><br>

        I'm a quantitative software engineer with Google, working on
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/persistent-disk">Persistent Disk</a>.
        In the main, I use machine learning techniques to guess how many real hard
        drives Google should buy for every virtual hard drive they sell.  I've also worked on 
        <a href="https://fi.google.com">Google Fi</a>'s network quality team (I got to do some
        Android development there), as well as metrics and selection work for the search engine's
        public web index.
        <br><br>

        Pre-Google, I was a data scientist at <a href="http://upwork.com/">Upwork</a>, working
        on matching and ranking for their online labor marketplace. Before that, I was a data
        scientist at <a href="http://quantifind.com/">Quantifind</a> trying to mine social media comments
        in a way that could predict the health of a product's marketing campaign.
        <br><br>

        I got my Ph.D. at the U.C. Berkeley EECS department
        in 2012, working with <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/">Laurent El Ghaoui</a> as
        part of the StatNews research group. Before that, I got my B.S. in electrical engineering in 2005
        from the University of Virginia, where I concentrated on statistical signal processing
        with a computer science minor.
        <br>

      <h2>Fun Stuff I've Made</h2>

      <ul>

        <li><a href="./twitter_bots.html"><b>Twitter Bots</b></a>:
          Read about how I made a bunch of bots for Twitter, including
          <a href="https://twitter.com/each_wordsquare">@each_wordsquare</a>,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fakespearean">@fakespearean</a>, 
          <a href="https://twitter.com/ellipsabelle">@ellipsabelle</a>, and my
          <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Abgawalt%20%23ReaderBot&f=live">#ReaderBot</a>.
          (They're all on hiatus right now, except for #ReaderBot which is instead running on my
          <a href="https://lebrady.net/tags/ReaderBot">Mastodon account</a>.)
        </li><br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/bgawalt/my_wordle"><b>My Wordle</b></a>: The online word
          game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> lets you share
          a little green-yellow-grey tile pattern that reflects how you did on today's puzzle.
          (You know the ones; they were all over Twitter; it's why the game was such a hit.)
          I generated the average color of each tile over a history of 160-odd puzzle results.
          It looks like
          <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgawalt/my_wordle/main/bgawalt_20220718.png">
            this</a>.  (Apr.&nbsp;2022)
        </li><br>

        <li>
          <a href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/wiggly-distributions-and-nonparametrics-4e277e3939cf">
          <b>Wiggly Distributions and Nonparametrics</b></a>: A blog post that exploring what
          happens if you apply a nonparametric estimator to data drawn from discontinuous
          distributions. (Jan.&nbsp;2019)
        </li><br>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/bgawalt/wav_project"><b>WAVProject</b></a>: You can take a
          short snippet of audio, and repeatedly layer scaled-and-time-shifted copies of it.  If you
          do this enough times, with the right scale factors applied at the right time-shifts, you
          can make the big pile of short snippets start to aurally resemble one much longer snippet.
          (You're <i>projecting</i> the long <i>.wav</i> file onto the basis defined by the short
          .wav file, is where the name comes from.) The effect this makes is pretty cool. You can
          hear a demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX28us6bGVQ">here</a>, where the 
          short snippet "BUILD" is used to recreate a longer snippet, "THE MACHINE."

        </li><br>

        <li>
          <a href="https://gawalt.com/dice"><b>Dice Roller</b></a>: Gentle lil' JavaScript exercise
          to roll "four eight-sided dice" or "three six-sided dice", etc., from back when I played
          D&D.  Mostly now use it to randomly pick albums to play from my Spotify library.
          (May&nbsp;2015)
        </li><br>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/bgawalt/uuidBabyName"><b>UUID Baby Names</b></a>:
          A goofy utility for turning the output of <a href="http://www.uuidgenerator.net/">
          http://www.uuidgenerator.net/</a> into a human-pronounceable name. (May&nbsp;2013)
        </li><br>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/bgawalt/CityPicker"><b>City Picker</b></a>:
          Selects an American ZIP code at random, proportional to that ZIP's population,
          and gives you its city name. Inspired by the wide and diverse array of cities
          found in Josh Boruff's
